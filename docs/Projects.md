# Projects

### Step 1. Remember projects at Resume

**Example Prompts:**

> Inside Text, there are projects in my Resume
> Text: {
> Experience: Software Developer at X Company
> - Developed and launched 3 successful software products in a team of 5 within a timeframe of 6 months
> - Reduced the product's API request time by 50%, leading to optimized system performance and improved user experience
> - Implemented clean and efficient coding practices which resulted in a 25% increase in overall code quality
> - Conducted over 200 unit tests and detected and resolved 99% of issues before product release
> - Improved the communication and collaboration within the team by implementing Agile methodology, resulting in 30% faster project completion.
>
> Projects: Online Marketplace Platform (Java)
> - Successfully completed the project within the given deadline, delivering all the promised functionalities and features
> - Optimized backend server response time by 40% by implementing advanced caching techniques and API indexing
> - Developed the platform's Restful API, utilizing Swagger UI, reducing the API call response time by 50%
> - Managed and resolved over 150 bugs during the QA process, resulting in a 98% acceptance rate
> - Received a 4.8/5 rating on the platform from 1000+ active users, indicating high user satisfaction with the product.
>     }
> Remember and answer OK

**Answer**
> OK

### Step 2. Ask questions based on projects

**Example Prompts:**
> Tell me 10 questions based on my projects in SWE interview.

**Answer**
> - What motivated you to choose the Online Marketplace Platform project?
> - Can you walk me through the development process of the Marketplace Platform?
> - How did you optimize the backend server response time?
> - What approach did you take to manage and resolve over 150 bugs during the QA process?
> - How did you implement the Restful API utilizing Swagger UI?
> - What was the most challenging aspect of developing the Marketplace Platform?
> - How did you ensure that all the promised functionalities and features were delivered within the given deadline?
> - What testing methodologies did you follow to ensure product quality?
> - Can you describe a time when you faced a technical issue during the development process of this project and how you resolved it?
> - What did you learn from working on this project and how has it helped you in your career?

### Step 3. Use STAR method / bullet points to answer questions
You can try to answer the question before asking chatbot, after that, you can compare your answer with chatbot's answer, 

#### For a specific question or event, use the STAR method.

> **Note:** When you use STAR method, your answer should focus on Action(A) and Result(R). 

**Example Prompts:**
> Give me an example answer for "How did you optimize the backend server response time?", your answer should use STAR method.

**Answer:**

> Sure, here is an example answer using the STAR method:
> 
> Situation: Our team was working on developing an Online Marketplace Platform project, and I was responsible for optimizing the backend server response time.
> 
> Task: The customer's requirement was to ensure that the platform could handle a high volume of traffic without compromising the performance of the application.
> 
> Action: My approach was to analyze the server performance and identify the bottlenecks that caused the slow response time. I discovered that the database query execution was taking the most time. To optimize the response time, I implemented advanced caching techniques, such as Memcached, to store frequently accessed database queries in memory. Moreover, I created an index for APIs that were frequently accessed, which helped to enhance the database query time drastically.
> 
> Result: These optimizations led to a reduction of 40% in the backend server response time. As a result, the platform could handle a high volume of traffic with improved performance, enhancing the user experience.
> 
> Overall, my focus on identifying the bottleneck and implementing advanced caching techniques and API indexing helped to optimize the response time, resulting in improved system performance and a better user experience.

#### For a general question, use bullet points

**Example Prompts:**
> Give me an example answer for "What testing methodologies did you follow to ensure product quality?", your answer should split into 3 bullet points and every point should start with keywords for summary.

**Answer:**
> Sure, here is an example answer:
> 
> To ensure product quality for the Online Marketplace Platform project, I followed several testing methodologies that covered a wide range of scenarios, such as functional, performance, and user acceptance testing. Here are three key methods I used:
> 
> Functional Tests: I conducted over 100 functional tests to ensure that each module of the platform was performing as expected. These tests covered different scenarios, such as user authentication, product listing, and transaction processing.
> 
> Performance Tests: I performed load testing to verify the platform's ability to handle a user load without causing any delays or downtime. I used tools such as JMeter to simulate a high volume of user traffic and received promising results.
> 
> User Acceptance Tests: I involved users in the testing phase to validate the developed modules against their requirements. I conducted surveys and questionnaires to identify the platform's shortcomings and areas that needed attention. Additionally, I organized feedback sessions with the users to discuss their experiences and suggestions.
> 
> Overall, by following these methodologies, I ensured that the product was thoroughly tested and validated against the customer's requirements. These tests covered all aspects of the product and ensured that it performed as expected, giving customers confidence in the platform's quality.
